As part of the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design certification, I've created my personal portolio using FlexBox. 

Some things I've learned while building it:

✔️ Learned how to install Gulp package, how to create and run Gulp tasks.
✔️ Used gulp to apply autoprefixer to my flexbox css so that it's cross browser friendly.
✔️ Learned how to automate this process by creating a Gulp task that watches all the CSS styles changes and overrides the new stylesheet automatically.

Technologies used: JavaScript, NodeJS HTML, CSS,  command line.
