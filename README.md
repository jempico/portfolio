As part of the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design certification, I've created my personal portolio using FlexBox. 

Some things I've learned while building it:

1- Learned how to install Gulp package and run CSS prefix tasks.
2- Used gulp to apply autoprefixer to my flexbox css so that it's cross browser friendly.
3- Learned how to automate this process.
